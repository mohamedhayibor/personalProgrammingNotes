#### How to read a technical book - paper

1. Get the big picture of what's going on (pause and summarize into your own words frequently)
2. Explain it to a friend
3. Summarize what you know - phrase questions for what you don't
4. Write down questions (what confuses you)
5. Think for yourself (be super pragmatic - tear it apart)

#### Object creation

Creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Two dominant ideas when it comes to creational design patterns:

1. encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
2. Hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined

Further categorization:

1. Object-creational patterns: deal with object creation (defer part of its object creation to another object)
2. class-creational pattern: class intantiation (defer its object creation to subclasses)
