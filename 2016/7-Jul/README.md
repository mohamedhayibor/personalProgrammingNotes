Notes from [rnn-effectiveness](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness)

Recurrent nets allow us to operate over sequences of vectors.

RNNs are turing complete in the sense that they can simulate arbitrary programs (with proper weights).

RNN computation: RNNs accept an input vector x and give you an output vector y. (the output vector's contents are influenced not only by the input you just fed in, but also on the entire history of inputs you've fed in the past.
